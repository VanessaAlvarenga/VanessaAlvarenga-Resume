        <div class="subheading mb-5">Political ScienceðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Thereâ€™s a gap in my employment while in my resume. During this period, I elected to take a leave from the workforce in order to go back to school. The time that I was able to commit to my education has been invaluable to my professional growth, and I am eager to re-enter the professional sphere and apply my new found qualifications and knowledge to the job. I am currently working at Crystal Stairs as a Program Assistance. My primary job is to scan, file and organize legal documents. Such legal documents consist of agreements between vendors, lease agreements, and fraud cases. I've been working with this company for 4 months now, due to my hectic school schedule I am unable to hold that position for full time, instead my supervisor allows me to do part time 3 days a week. My previous experience in the legal department of a law office prepared me for this position to an extent. I have worked in two previous law offices, one was for work compensation and the other for civil cases.  I left my previous job due to a difference in opinion (the civil office) and the work compensation job was due to commuting struggles. For the past two months I have been planning my relocation and searching for an appropriate job that allows me to showcase my new found knowledge and that helps me grow in my career. <br><br><br><br>

        Throughout the course of my career, I have perfected my communication and leadership abilities. I am a capable and consistent problem-solver skilled at prioritizing and managing projects with proficiency. In my previous role, I contributed communication, customer service, and initiative  toward team efforts and business improvements. I am progressive minded and in tune with new developments in my field. I have proven to be effective and collaborative with strong leadership talents. I enjoy collective brainstorming sessions which allow me to coordinate activities to achieve a common goal. I am currently working towards a Political Science degree in hopes of going to Law School and becoming a criminal lawyer. Through my classes and everyday life at work I am to learn and grasp a better understanding of the struggles and gaps in our judicial system.<br><br>

        As I stand now I have experience in Customer service, my first job was in a car insurance company, than I went to work for an alarm company in the customer service department, but as I advance in my career school work I decided to start looking for jobs in the legal field, which is how I found my first job the Work Compensation office as General Assistance. 
        Due to living in Los  Angeles and going to school in Riverside I am unable to find a full time job without compromising my studies. But as I moved forward in my career I saw that it has been to my benefit to enroll in school and advance my knowledge of the legal system. It has open opportunities  to work areas such as working directly with the legal aid department.
